📍 Key Findings (Minimum 5)

✔ Footwear category contributes the highest revenue, accounting for the majority of total sales.
✔ Sales exhibit clear seasonal trends, with major spikes during Q4 (holiday shopping).
✔ Men’s product segment outperforms women’s and kids’ categories in total volume, but women’s products show a higher average selling price.
✔ Discounted products significantly increase unit sales, but reduce average profit per item—indicating a price-sensitive customer base.
